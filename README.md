# OME Common C++

OME Common is a standalone C++ library required by other OME C++
projects for common functionality which is not readily available from
the C++ Standard Library.  This includes basic portability functions,
to wrapping other libraries to make them usable with Modern C++
programming practices.

It serves a similar purpose to the OME formats-common Java library,
with some shared functionality, though for the most part they are
quite different.

Purpose
-------

OME Common's primary purpose is to ensure that a certain level of
basic functionality is provided for all platforms and compilers
supported by OME C++ projects.  It currently includes:

- Missing C++ standard library functionality:

  * regex

- Missing Boost functionality:

  * Endian conversions
  * Filesystem absolute path determination
  * Variant and MPL set up
  * Units (extended datatypes for all units used by the OME data
    model)

- Extra functionality:

  * Boolean type for iterable 8-bit mask pixel data
  * logging
  * installation path determination
  * memory streams
  * string portability and helper functions
  * XML parsing (Xerces-C++ Modern C++ RAII wrappers)
